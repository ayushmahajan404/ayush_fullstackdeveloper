        <h2> <span style="color: seagreen;">Information</span> :-Jeffrey Preston Bezos </h2>
        <h4> Jeff Bezos is an American entrepreneur best known as the founder and former CEO of Amazon, the world's
            largest online retailer. Born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Bezos displayed an early
            aptitude for science and technology. He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1986 with
            degrees in electrical engineering and computer science.

            Bezos began his career in finance, working at several firms including Fitel, Bankers Trust, and D. E. Shaw &
            Co. It was during his time at D. E. Shaw & Co. in the early 1990s that Bezos identified the potential of the
            internet and decided to start an online bookstore. In 1994, he left his job and founded Amazon.com out of
            his garage in Seattle, Washington.

            Amazon started as an online bookstore but quickly expanded its offerings to include a wide range of
            products, eventually becoming the "everything store." Under Bezos's leadership, Amazon revolutionized
            e-commerce, introducing innovations like one-click purchasing, personalized recommendations, and Prime
            two-day shipping.

            Bezos's bold vision and relentless focus on long-term growth propelled Amazon to become one of the most
            valuable and influential companies in the world. In addition to its core e-commerce business, Amazon
            expanded into cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS), digital streaming with Amazon Prime Video, and
            hardware devices like the Kindle e-reader and Echo smart speaker.

            In February 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO of Amazon to focus on other ventures,
            including his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his philanthropic efforts. He was succeeded by
            Andy Jassy, the former head of AWS. Despite stepping down as CEO, Bezos remains one of the largest
            shareholders of Amazon and continues to exert significant influence over the company's direction.

            Bezos's entrepreneurial success has made him one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. He has been
            recognized for his innovation and leadership, receiving numerous awards and honors throughout his career.
            Additionally, Bezos is known for his interest in space exploration and has invested billions of dollars into
            Blue Origin, which aims to make space travel more accessible to civilians.

            Overall, Jeff Bezos's journey from a humble online bookstore to a global e-commerce giant is a testament to
            the power of vision, innovation, and persistence in the world of business.

            Gates established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world's largest private philanthropic
            foundations. The foundation focuses on global health, education, and poverty alleviation, working on
            initiatives such as eradicating polio, combating malaria and other infectious diseases, and improving access
            to education and healthcare in developing countries.

            While Gates stepped down from his day-to-day role at Microsoft in 2008 to focus more on philanthropy, he
            remains involved in various projects related to technology and global development. His influence extends not
            only through his business ventures but also through his philanthropic efforts to address some of the world's
            most pressing challenges.
